# Chinese Liquor NIR Hyperspectral Imaging Dataset

This repository contains the Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI) dataset of Chinese liquor samples used in the paper "Exploring Spectral Signatures of Chinese liquor using Machine Learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations" (ICASSP 2025).

## Dataset Description

- **Samples**: 19 types of Chinese liquor covering 5 aroma types and various alcohol contents
- **Spectral Range**: 900-1700 nm
- **Number of Bands**: 224
- **Spatial Resolution**: 640 pixels
- **Number of Acquisitions**: 60 repetitions per sample

## Data Structure

- `raw_data/`: Raw hyperspectral images
- `processed_data/`: Preprocessed spectral data
- `metadata.csv`: Sample information (brand, aroma type, alcohol content)

## Usage

This dataset is intended for research on Chinese liquor classification and analysis using NIR-HSI. It can be used to:

1. Classify Chinese liquor by aroma type and alcohol content
2. Explore spectral signatures associated with different liquor characteristics
3. Develop and test machine learning models for liquor analysis
